#### Disclaimer
- If a course fits within multiple learning categories, the legend filter only applies the filter based on the first learning category.
- All courses that are only passed by <=5 D&I students are anonymized data and has been assigned 5.0 as the value in order to calculate the percentage of D&I students in a course. This means that it is likely that courses with few students have a higher percentage of D&I than in reality.
