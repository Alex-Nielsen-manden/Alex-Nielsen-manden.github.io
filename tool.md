# Course Selection Tool
Selecting courses can be like navigating a jungle, especially the electives. For this reason, we now introduce a tool that can help you with:
- Filtering courses to only see your specific learning interests by using the legend.
- Navigating between courses based on their evaluation score and the amount of D&I students attending the course, which may act as an indicator to how relevant the course is.
- Inspecting other valuable course data by clicking the course dots.

<small>Hint: *Click the reset button ![reset](/Data%20load/reset.png) in the upper right corner to reset the navigation.*</small>

## Secondary tool
Selecting semi-elective courses can be a challenge too. To help the process, this tool only displays those.

### Disclaimer
- Only courses that have been passed by D&I Msc. students in the period 2020-2024 are included.
- The data related to any datapoint is taken from the course passed the latest by a D&I Msc. student.
- The evaluation score is the mean value of the evaluation data: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, obtained from the DTU course base.
- A course may apply to multiple learning categories, but in tool only one has been chosen.
- All courses that are only passed by <=5 D&I students are anonymized data. In order to calculate the percentage of D&I students in a course, the number of D&I students have been set to 5.0 in these cases. This means that it is likely that courses with few students and <=5 D&I students have a higher percentage of D&I than in reality.
