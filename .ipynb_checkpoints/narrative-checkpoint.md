# Introduction

This dataset includes course information for MSc Design and Innovation students at the Technical University of Denmark, covering the period from 2020 to the present. It shows how many students from the program have taken each course, what their average grades were, and how they rated the courses overall.

The original idea behind collecting this data was to build a tool that could help future students choose the right courses based on feedback from their peers—basically to make it easier to navigate the overwhelming number of options in the DTU course catalog. The hope was that such a tool might even encourage students to consider courses they wouldn’t normally come across when browsing the catalog on their own.

As the project developed, the focus shifted toward spotting patterns in student choices, grades, and course ratings over time. Since the data goes back to 2020, a natural question is whether the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 and 2021 had any noticeable effect on grades or how students rated their courses during those years.

So, this project has two main goals: to explore how course preferences and opinions have evolved among past students, and to create a helpful tool for future students to make more informed course decisions.

To better get an overview of the different courses we have diveded them into 10 different catagories namely

- Circularity & Sustainability
- Design for People
- Management & Business
- MedTech
- Manufacturing & Materials
- Product Design
- Smart Products
- Supply Chain
- Systems Engineering
- Technical Competences
